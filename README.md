## Installation

> Not released on PyPI yet ðŸ˜…

```bash
pip install httpx-ws
```

## Quickstart

`httpx-ws` provides `connect_ws` and `aconnect_ws` to help connecting and communication with WebSockets. The resulting `WebSocketSession`/`AsyncWebSocketSession` object provides helpers to send and receive messages in the WebSocket.

**Sync**

```py
import httpx
from httpx_ws import connect_ws

with httpx.Client() as client:
    with connect_ws(client, "http://localhost:8000/ws") as ws:
        message = ws.receive_text()
        print(message)
        ws.send_text("Hello!")
```

**Async**

```py
import httpx
from httpx_ws import aconnect_ws

async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
    async with aconnect_ws(client, "http://localhost:8000/ws") as ws:
        message = await ws.receive_text()
        print(message)
        await ws.send_text("Hello!")
```

## Development

### Setup environment

We use [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/) to manage the development environment and production build. Ensure it's installed on your system.

### Run unit tests

You can run all the tests with:

```bash
hatch run test
```

### Format the code

Execute the following command to apply `isort` and `black` formatting:

```bash
hatch run lint
```
